# Final SEO Deployment Checklist

This checklist will guide you through the final steps before and after deploying your portfolio to ensure optimal SEO performance.

## 8. Pre-launch Checklist

*   [ ] **Double-check all meta tags:** Ensure your `title`, `description`, `robots`, and `canonical` tags are correct on all pages.
*   [ ] **Validate structured data:** Use the [Schema Markup Validator](https://validator.schema.org/) to test your JSON-LD.
*   [ ] **Test Open Graph and Twitter Cards:** Use the [Open Graph Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/) and the [Twitter Card Validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator) to preview how your site will look when shared.
*   [ ] **Check `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml`:** Ensure both files are in the `public` directory and are accessible.
*   [ ] **Image ALT text:** Make sure all images have descriptive ALT text.
*   [ ] **Broken links:** Run a broken link checker to ensure all internal and external links are working.
*   [ ] **Mobile-friendliness:** Test your site on multiple mobile devices to ensure it's fully responsive.
*   [ ] **Performance audit:** Run a Lighthouse audit in Chrome DevTools to check your Core Web Vitals and overall performance.

## Post-launch Google Search Console Actions

*   [ ] **Verify ownership:** If you haven't already, add your site to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console) and verify ownership.
*   [ ] **Submit your sitemap:** In Google Search Console, go to `Sitemaps` and submit your sitemap URL: `https://www.abdelkbirnainiaa.me/sitemap.xml`.
*   [ ] **Request indexing:** For your homepage, use the URL Inspection tool in Search Console and click "Request Indexing" to get it crawled quickly.

## Indexing Verification Steps

*   **Check indexing status:** In Google Search Console, use the URL Inspection tool to see if your pages are indexed.
*   **Site search on Google:** A few days after launch, search on Google for `site:abdelkbirnainiaa.me`. This will show you which pages Google has indexed.
*   **Monitor keywords:** Track your ranking for your name and other target keywords in Google Search Console's Performance report.

By following this checklist, you'll be in a great position to maximize your portfolio's SEO success.
